This project is to practice how to manipulate form elements using React.

I tried:
`input`
`textarea`
`button`
`checkbox`
`radio`
`select`

On clicking `enroll` browser logs all entered data. React state keeps track of every data. React also controls every input. It tells what to be displayed, not the tag telling it what has been displayed.

This suitable for large screens only. Future update will make it responsive.
